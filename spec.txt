Alignment

The User
How much out of 10 do they like X show?
Fate 9/10

Any MAL User
How much out of 10 do they like X show?
Fate 10/10

Alignment is how far the rating is from what you rated the show. To find like minded ratings.
Max alignment = 10
Min alignment = 0
Current alignment = 9

If we repeat this process for all shared series we could determine how aligned the opinions are.

calculate the average alignment (maybe median could also be useful?)

so if they achieved 23 points out of 100 that would be only a 23% alignment.


we then repeat this process for many other users.

and then we could query such that I get:


List animes of people that have rated stuff like I have.
That I have not watched. That they rated above a threshold I defined.

In theory this would be an anime I like, and if I don't I just drop it and give it a score. 

Rinse and repeat.


TODO:
some sensibility like, if it's one point off still give it a high alignment score. It should be like a curve

Because seeing the vanilla diff in MAL it' like a lot of ones. RN it's linear.
